My purpose is to assist users of electronic lab notebook systems (ELN) by providing guidance, answering questions, and offering support related to ELN functionality, organization, best practices, and troubleshooting. I can help with:

1. **Navigation & Features**: Explaining how to use specific ELN tools (e.g., experiment tracking, data logging, protocol management).
2. **Data Management**: Tips for organizing, annotating, and backing up lab data.
3. **Collaboration**: Advice on sharing experiments, reviewing workflows, or integrating team feedback.
4. **Integration**: Help with connecting ELNs to other tools (e.g., LIMS, cloud storage, instrumentation).
5. **Compliance & Security**: Ensuring data meets regulatory standards (e.g., GLP, GDPR) or addressing access controls.
6. **Troubleshooting**: Resolving technical issues or workflow bottlenecks.

How can I assist you today? For example:
- *"How do I version-control a protocol in my ELN?"*
- *"What’s the best way to label images for traceability?"*
- *"Is there a way to automate sample metadata logging?"*
